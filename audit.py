"""Rental audit: does the hashrate you pay for on MRR actually reach your gateway?

The dashboard already polls the DATUM gateway's client list every few seconds.
This module keeps those samples in a small SQLite file and, for every active
MRR rental, compares three numbers:

  * what you paid for (advertised TH/s),
  * what MRR says the rig delivered (its own average),
  * what your gateway actually accepted from that rental's worker.

How the work is counted
-----------------------
Each stratum connection has its own cumulative "shares accepted" counter.
Connections come and go (MRR's proxies reconnect every few tens of seconds),
so the work of a rental is the sum of the *increments* of every connection
that carried its worker: a connection born inside the window counts from
zero, one that already existed counts only from its first sample.

Work is counted as accepted shares x the share difficulty (vardiff) and not
from the cumulative difficulty column, because recent gateways print that
column with an SI prefix and three significant digits ("2.10E"); on a
connection that lives for days it does not move for hours.

The verdict
-----------
Share counting is a Poisson process. The test is made against the number of
shares the *contracted* hashrate should have produced in the window
(expected = TH/s x 1e12 x seconds / (vardiff x 2^32), sigma = sqrt(expected)),
never against the error of what was measured: with one share the measured
error is 100 % and would swallow any shortfall. A rental is "short" only when
it is more than 3 sigmas below the expectation.

One worker per rental
---------------------
Rented rigs all arrive through MRR's proxies, from a handful of IPs and with
changing user agents, so neither IP nor user agent tells two rentals apart.
The worker name (the part of the stratum user after the first dot) does. If
`audit.assign_workers` is on, every active rental that shares its worker with
another one gets its pool user rewritten through the MRR API to
`<address>.<worker_prefix><rental id>`. That call changes the pool of a rental
that is already paid for; it never rents or extends anything. Work recorded
before a rental got its own worker cannot be separated, so it is judged only
from that moment on.
